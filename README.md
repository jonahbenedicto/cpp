# Introduction to the C++ Programming Language

## Including Libraries
Use `#include` to include library.
Use `iostream` library for input and output stream.

## Main Function
Use the `main` function as the main entry point into the program.

## Input and Output
Use `std:cin` for input and `std:cout` for output available in the `iostream` library.

## Variables and Data Types
Variables must be declared with a data type.
Here are the data types that can be used.

```cpp
int x;
float y;
double z;
char c;
bool b;
```
